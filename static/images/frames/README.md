# Frames for layout mockups

Place `iphone.webp` here for mobile case layout blocks.

The frame should be a PNG/WebP with a transparent center (screen area). The user's screenshot will be displayed inside that area.

Recommended: iPhone mockup frame with dimensions ~390×844px (or similar), screen cutout ~375×812px.
