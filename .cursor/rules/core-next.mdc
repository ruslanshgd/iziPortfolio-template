Use the todo_tool to break down tasks into sub-tasks


0. Look and write the nearest action plan to chat, what is your output? what test cases? which {projectname}.todo.md are you working with? what did you lose from previous actions?

1. read and apply
.cursor/rules/core-auto.mdc

2. only after you apply and complete point 1 → read and apply
.cursor/rules/core-check.mdc

3. only after you apply and complete point 2 → read and apply
.cursor/rules/core-clean.mdc

4. only at the very end, check and write next actions based on what you wrote to chat and what we need to do according to {projectname}.todo.md?

do we need to update the action plan? and how?
