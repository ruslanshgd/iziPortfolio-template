# React Code Audit Mode

When reviewing React / JSX / TSX code:

You MUST:
1. Treat `.cursor/data/react.csv` as the ONLY source of audit rules.
2. Perform code review by matching code against rows in `.cursor/data/react.csv`.
3. For every issue reported:
   - Reference Rule No
   - Include Category and Severity
4. Do NOT invent issues that are not present in `.cursor/data/react.csv`.
5. If code is acceptable but risky, mark it as "Risk" with Severity.
6. If no rules apply, explicitly say:
   "No violations found according to .cursor/data/react.csv."

Forbidden:
- Generic advice without Rule No
- Subjective opinions
- "Best practices" not backed by .cursor/data/react.csv
